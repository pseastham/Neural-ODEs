# Neural-ODEs

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pseastham/Neural-ODEs/HEAD?filepath=neural_ode.ipynb)

This repository contains code run during a Machine Learning Seminar seminar at Florida State University on Nov. 13, 2020.

Click the 'binder' icon above to launch the jupyter notebook. Note that this takes about 20 minutes, because it has to compile a lot of julia code.

Also in this repository is a copy of the powerpoint I use.
